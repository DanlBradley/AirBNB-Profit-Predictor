# Phase2Project- Airbnb Market Analysis


## Navigating this Repo
The student.ipynbâ€‹ is the final notebook with markdown and code. The data file contains the King County Housing Data and Airbnb Data files that we based our multilinear regression on. The Phase 2- Flatiron PDF is our powerpoint presenting our findings.

## Overview

The project used a multilinear regression model to predict home prices of Airbnb homes based on King County housing data. We also identified the top features of profitable Airbnbs from over 120 features. 

## Business Problem
We identified features of profitable Airbnb properties for individuals interested in investing in Seattle real estate with the goal of opening an Airbnb as a passive income source. 

## Methods
This project used a multilinear regression model to predict the home values of Airbnb homes. We then used the predicted home value to calculate return on investment and identify the key predictors in return on investment for an Airbnb home in the Seattle area. 

## Conclusion
Our model predicted that investors should plan to purchase a home valued between $400K- $600K. 

Our model also found that key predictors in return on investment were the neighborhood that Airbnb was located, the accuracy of the listing, the number of guests the listing was able to accomodate, and booking flexibility. Investors should plan to invest in the High Point, Dunlap, and North Delridge neighborhoods. We also found that investors should focus on increasing the number of guests they're able to accommodate to ensure a high ROI.
